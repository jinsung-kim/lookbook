# Lookbook
A program inspired by the site Grailed, in which users can store items that they like in a collection. This application
expands on that idea, by allowing users to add pieces from any site that they desire.

This project was created to encourage others to practice sustainable fashion, by limiting their closet and style to pieces 
that they truly want, rather than purchasing many fast trendy pieces. By being able to curating a closet, users are also able 
to develop their own unique sense of style.

On top of that, an algorithm is able to help users find new brands based on their previous selections. While this feature is
still in testing, I hope to push it out as soon as possible.
