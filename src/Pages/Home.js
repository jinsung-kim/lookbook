                        <h4>Philosophy</h4>
                        <p>A means to reduce the impact of fast fashion, and the constant need to buy.</p>
                        <p>When we see something on sale, our immediate instinct is to purchase.</p>
                        <p>We end up with a closet in which we over consume.</p>
                        <p>Lookbook encourages sustainable fashion, and mindful purchasing, by pushing users to think deeper about what they want.</p>
