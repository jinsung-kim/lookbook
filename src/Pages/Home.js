                <p>Skate, art, LA, NYC, fashion goes beyond</p>
                <p>A means to eliminate fast fashion, and the constant need to buy</p>
                <p>When we see something on sale, our immediate instinct is to purchase</p>
                <p>We end up with a closet in which we barely touch a lot of what we consume</p>
                <p>Lookbook encourages sustainable fashion, and mindful purchasing</p>
                <p>Experiment with how colors collide with each other</p>
                <p>Use our algorithm to determine what defines you</p>
                <p>Whether it's form or functionality or trying to find that perfect piece</p>
                <p>Break some rules, redefine what fashion means to you</p>
